--------------------------
Project game built by JQuery

This game project will help students or anyone new/familiar with JQuery and JavaScript. 

You have four options to choose as your fighter. After you choose your player, the remaining players will automatically move to the enemy section. You will choose one player at a time as your opponent. You will be prompted to choose another player if you kill(your opponent's health power) is below zero. Contrarily you will lose if your health point is below zero. 

It is useful to understand or use as a reference for the concept of 
            - DOM manipulation 
            - Binding an events to multiple classes,elements, id etc...
            - Scope 
            - Objects
            - Arrays
            
            
 I recommend you to look at the HTML before jumping into either JQuery or CSS

I have tried to give a comment on all the jquery functions and variables which I hope will help you understand the code easily.
